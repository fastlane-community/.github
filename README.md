# fastlane Community
[fastlane Community](https://github.com/fastlane-community) is a GitHub organization dedicated to housing and collaborating on [fastlane plugins](https://docs.fastlane.tools/plugins/using-plugins/#fastlane-plugins). The fastlane core contributors and the fastlane community will both work side by side to keep quality and long-term support as many plugins as possible.

## Plugin Inclusion
_fastlane Community_ will tend keep two things in mind when considering a plugin to be included.
1) A highly used and important feature needed by many _fastlane_ users
2) A plugin that can no longer be maintained by its owner that has _fastlane_ users that needs a home

There are exceptions to these inclusion guidelines that will be handled on a case by case basis.

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/fastlane-community/.github/issues/new) if you would like your plugin to be considered for inclusion ðŸ’ª
